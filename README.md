Project Overview
This mini-project implements a Dead Code Elimination (DCE) tool as part of compiler optimization. Dead code elimination removes code segments that do not affect program output, reducing executable size, improving performance, and lowering energy consumption. The project also aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action) by fostering energy-efficient software development.

Project Objectives
Understand theoretical foundations of dead code elimination in compiler optimization.

Implement data flow analysis techniques (liveness analysis, reaching definitions).

Develop a prototype tool to find unreachable code, unused variables, redundant computations.

Demonstrate improvements in code efficiency and energy consumption.

Provide thorough technical and impact documentation.

Features
Control Flow Graph construction.

Data Flow Analysis: use-definition and definition-use chains, liveness analysis.

Dead Code Detection algorithms: unreachable code, dead variables, dead stores.

Command-line interface for tool usage.

Testing suite covering various dead code scenarios.

Weekly Study Plan
Weeks 1-2: Foundation, literature review.

Weeks 3-5: Data flow and dead code detection algorithms.

Week 6: Tool development and integration.

Week 7: Testing and validation.

Weeks 8-10: Documentation, performance analysis, and presentation preparation.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python/Java/C++ (choose as appropriate)

Parser generators: ANTLR, PLY (optional)

Git and GitHub for version control

Deliverables
Source code (with comments)

User manual, technical documentation

Test cases, performance analysis

Final presentation and demo
